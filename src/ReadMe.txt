The app is a messaging application designed to send and 
receive text messages between two or more users. To 
design and implement the messaging application Java 
and SQL was used. Additionally, public and private 
messages can be sent to any connected or non-connected 
user. There is a coordinator that manages the group chat
by adding or removing the user from it. On the other 
hand, the database is a stateful system that maintains 
information about all the members and information used 
by the application. This includes information such as 
user profiles, available groups, chat history, and message 
delivery status.
